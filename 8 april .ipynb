    "In the case of predicting the actual price of a house, Mean Squared Error (MSE) would be more appropriate as the evaluation metric. \n",

    "In a dataset with a significant number of outliers, Mean Absolute Error (MAE) would be a more appropriate regression metric to use with an SVM model than Mean Squared Error (MSE). \n",
    "This is because MSE heavily penalizes large errors, which can be amplified by outliers and may not be representative of the overall performance of the model.\n",
    "On the other hand, MAE is less sensitive to outliers as it calculates the absolute difference between the predicted and actual values, rather than the squared difference.\n",
    "Therefore, MAE provides a better measure of the average error in the predictions, which can be useful in scenarios where outliers are present."
